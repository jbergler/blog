I'm Jonas.
I'm a software engineer based in [Wellington, New Zealand](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wellington/@-41.0745392,172.7610101,6z).

I'm really passionate about making things simple.

Currently I'm working on [semgrep](https://semgrep.dev).
I've also had the pleasure of working at other great companies such as [Meraki](https://meraki.com) and [Snap](https://snap.net.nz).

Outside of work, I try to ride my bicyles as regularly as possible.
I'm learning to fly planes and I enjoy building/making things.

I inhabit the internet as `jbergler`. Some of the places you'll find me include
